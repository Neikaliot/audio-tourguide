            </div>
            <p>Hanoi's history dates back over a millennium, with its origins rooted in the early days of Vietnamese civilization. The area where Hanoi now stands was first settled around 3,000 BC by the Red River Delta's indigenous people. However, it wasn't until 1010 AD that Hanoi truly began its journey as a significant political and cultural center.</p>
            <div class="readmore">
                <p>In 1010, Emperor Lý Thái Tổ of the Lý Dynasty moved the capital of Đại Việt (the ancient name of Vietnam) from Hoa Lư to this location and named it Thăng Long, meaning "Ascending Dragon." The decision was based on the city's strategic location, surrounded by rivers and fertile land, making it an ideal place for the kingdom's new capital. This event marked the beginning of Hanoi's rise as the heart of Vietnam.</p>

            </div>
            <p>During the Lý and Trần Dynasties (1010-1400), Thăng Long became a thriving center of culture, education, and religion. The city's layout was carefully planned, with a citadel at its core, surrounded by residential areas, markets, and temples. It was during this period that many of Hanoi's iconic landmarks were established, including the One Pillar Pagoda and the Temple of Literature, Vietnam's first university.</p>
            <div class="readmore">
                <p>The Lý Dynasty also introduced Buddhism as the state religion, leading to the construction of numerous pagodas and temples across the city. Thăng Long became a hub of religious activity, attracting scholars and monks from across the region.</p>

                <p>In the early 15th century, Hanoi experienced a period of turmoil when the Ming Dynasty of China invaded and occupied the city. During this time, many cultural artifacts and historical records were destroyed, but the spirit of the Vietnamese people remained unbroken.</p>
                <div class="readmore">
                    <p>The Ming occupation lasted until 1428 when Lê Lợi, a national hero, led a successful uprising against the Chinese invaders, founding the Lê Dynasty. The new dynasty restored the city's original name, Thăng Long, and ushered in a period of reconstruction and prosperity. The Lê Dynasty is known for consolidating Vietnamese independence and reinforcing the cultural identity of the nation.</p>

                </div>
                <p>In the 19th century, the Nguyễn Dynasty moved the capital to Huế, but Thăng Long, now known as Hanoi, remained an important administrative and cultural center. However, the city's fate took a significant turn in 1887 when it fell under French colonial rule.</p>
                <div class="readmore">
                    <p>The French transformed Hanoi into the capital of French Indochina, leaving a lasting impact on the city's architecture and urban planning. The French Quarter, with its wide boulevards, grand villas, and European-style buildings, stands as a testament to this period of Hanoi's history. Landmarks such as the Hanoi Opera House and St. Joseph's Cathedral are prominent examples of French colonial architecture that continue to define the city's landscape.</p>

                    <p>Despite the challenges of colonial rule, Hanoi remained a symbol of Vietnamese resilience and nationalism. The city's intellectuals and revolutionaries played a crucial role in the struggle for independence, culminating in the August Revolution of 1945, which marked the end of French colonialism in Vietnam.

                <p>Hanoi's history took another dramatic turn during the Vietnam War, also known as the American War in Vietnam. As the capital of North Vietnam, Hanoi was the political and military headquarters of the communist government led by Ho Chi Minh. The city endured intense bombings and hardships during the war, but its people demonstrated remarkable resilience.</p>

                    <p>In 1975, after the fall of Saigon and the reunification of North and South Vietnam, Hanoi was declared the capital of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.
